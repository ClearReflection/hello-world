Just another person following the Hello World article/guide/thing

Again? Can't I just copy my bio.... I'll just do that.
An Extrovert that's secretly an introvert, iridescent but blended.

Not in bio but can be very lazy unless excited about something... I think this is why I like cats more than dogs though I used to like dogs more than cats in the past, .... what happened to me?
Umm, I enjoy J-pop and EDM, Clasical, and K-pop. Favorite artist, or in this case, duo is HoneyComeBear.
I enjoy reading light novels and watching anime.
Also enjoy debating about useless things such as what is truly random and is time travel real. I'm going to leave the debate of if life is a simulation on the side, I was in that void for way too long.
